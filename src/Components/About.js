          This is a story of an incredible tiny senior cat who dared to dream BIG! She was rescued by <a id='shelter' href="https://sites.google.com/view/animal-house-of-se-michigan/" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Animal House of SE Michigan</a> and brought to PetSmart for adoption. Sadly, she was taken to her forever home twice but also returned to the shelter both times... When Justin walked in the store to buy a gift for his friend's dog and heard all the "meows" from the adoption cages, he couldn't resist looking at them. And once he locked his eyes with a tiny kitty, he knew it was love at first sight. Little did we know that our future companion was the only one that didn't meow! Just "meh".
          <br></br>
          Everyone who has ever met Toonces pointed out how outgoing and friendly she was, especially for a cat! She was like a dog but better - always knew where you were and always wanted to play - a truly marvellous kitty!
