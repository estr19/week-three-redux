          This is a story of an incredible tiny senior cat who dared to dream BIG! She was rescued by Julie from Animal House of SE Michigan and brought to PetSmart for adoption. Sadly, she was adopted twice but also returned twice. When Justin walked in the store to buy a gift for his friend's dog and heard all the Meows from the adoption cages, he couldn't resist looking at them. And once he locked his eyes with a tiny kitty, he knew it was love at first sight. Little did he know that our future companion didn't even meow! Just 'meh'.
