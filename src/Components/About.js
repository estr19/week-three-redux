          This is a story of an incredible tiny senior cat who dared to dream BIG! She was rescued by <a id='shelter' href="https://sites.google.com/view/animal-house-of-se-michigan/" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Animal House of SE Michigan</a> and brought to PetSmart for adoption. Sadly, she was taken to her forever home twice but also returned both times... When Justin walked in the store to buy a gift for his friend's dog and heard all the "meows" from the adoption cages, he couldn't resist looking at them. And once he locked his eyes with a tiny kitty, he knew it was love at first sight. Little did he know that our future companion was the only one that didn't meow! Just "meh".
